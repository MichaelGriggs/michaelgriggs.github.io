            The people who visit this site live adventurous lives but not with undue risk. These people are avid rock
            climbers that remain aware of weather conditions to make their ascents safely. They will often need to check
            on the road or between other commitments in their busy, millenial lives, so the site should respond just as
            well on mobile as it does on desktop. It should also use trendy design to keep the admittedly short
            attention spans of "kids these days".

        <ul>
            <li>Persona 1: <p>Maggie climbs on the weekends with her friend group. As she is the only one of the group
                    that embraces technology newer than 1979, they rely on her for weather forecasts so they know
                    whether to go with lederhosen and flannel or with thrift store button ups and thick-frame glasses.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Persona 2: <p>Charles, also known as "Charlie", "Chuck", and "Chuckles", is a stay-at-home-son who
                    took up rock climbing to get out of the house during lockdown. He's into computer development (he
                    installed a power supply once) and goes to rennaisance faires on the weekends. He obsseses over the
                    forecast being as up to date as possible.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Scenario 1:
                <p>
                    Climbing group on the road to a pile of rocks. Storm clouds visible off to the east. Someone pulls
                    out their phone to check the forecast near Fish Haven. They visit A-Climb-atize.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Scenario 2:
                <p>
                    A tourist is interested in rock climbing for their upcoming vacation. The wonderful SEO of
                    A-Climb-atize brings them to the site, where they view the gallery of weather and climbing-related
                    photos.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Scenario 3:
                <p>
                    A college outdoor activities group leader checks the forecast ahead of their trip that weekend, from
                    the computer in the office.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Scenario 4:
                <p>
                    A web development student visits the site to view examples of responsiveness.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Scenario 5:
                <p>
                    A local user doesn't realize the site is geared toward rock climbers, but uses it for weather data
                    anyway and it functions just fine for that purpose too.
